# Histogram Generator
Assignment 1 for SFU CMPT 276 Intoduction to Software Engineering. <br/><br/>
This webpage uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a Java SpringBoot application which was deployed using Render. Please note that the webpage is initialized with a default list of grades for assignment purposes. <br/> <br/>
Features:

1. The user may enter new values into this array by entering the number in the "New Grade" textbox. For this feature, the user can press the "submit" button to add the new value into the array. <br/><br/>
2. Each time the user changes the lower bounds of any of the letter-grades or when a new grade item is entered, the Histogram dynamically adjusts itself to represent the number of students in each range. <br/><br/>
3. If there is an invalid input of any kind, i.e. bounds of letter-grades overlap, string is entered as input, the program deals with it accordingly <br/> <br/>
